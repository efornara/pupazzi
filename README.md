Unofficial fork of [godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) 3, mostly to
have a smaller repo to work with.

The upstream README.md is now [here](GODOT_README.md).

Branches:

- **godot**: Godot stable releases as they come from upstream, but without commit
  histories.
- **frt**: Minor changes to the godot branch to unlock features and avoid hacks
  when compiling frt. [diff](https://github.com/efornara/pupazzi/compare/godot...frt)
- **master**: Might be used for something more interesting later. Right now,
  a more helpful landing page.
